## About

The [LTCÂ®2633](http://www.linear.com/product/LTC2633) is a family of dual 12-, 10-, and 8-bit voltage-output DACs with an integrated, high accuracy, low drift reference in an 8-lead TSOT-23 package.
These DACs communicate via a 2-wire I2C-compatible serial interface. The LTC2633 operates in both the standard mode (clock rate of 100kHz) and the fast mode (clock rate of 400kHz).

Arduino Library for LTC®2633 miniDAC Module


## About

This library is to communicate with Arduino miniDAC module by Tamojit Saha and Sandeepan Sengupta.
The miniDAC module is built arround LTC®2633 by Linear Technology, so this library can be used to communicate with LTC®2633 family of devices
Learn more about it here: https://github.com/SandeepanSengupta/miniDAC/blob/master/README.md

The LTC®2633 is a family of dual 12-, 10-, and 8-bit voltage-output DACs with an integrated, high accuracy, low drift reference in an 8-lead TSOT-23 package.
These DACs communicate via a 2-wire I2C-compatible serial interface. The LTC®2633 operates in both the standard mode (clock rate of 100kHz) and the fast mode (clock rate of 400kHz).
